CsCheck is a C# random testing library inspired by QuickCheck.

It differs in that generation and shrinking are both based on PCG, a fast random number generator.

This gives the following advantages:

- Automatic shrinking. Gen classes are composable with no need for Arb classes. So less boilerplate.
- Random testing and shrinking are parallelized. This and PCG make it very fast.
- Shrunk cases have a seed value. Simpler examples can easily be reproduced.
- Shrinking can be continued later to give simpler cases for high dimensional problems.
- Concurrency testing and random shrinking work well together.

CsCheck also makes concurrency, performance and regression testing simple and fast.
