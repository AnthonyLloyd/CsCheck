        <Description>CsCheck is a C# random and performance testing library inspired by QuickCheck.

It differs in that generation and shrinking are both based on PCG, a fast random number generator.

This gives the following advantages:

- Automatic shrinking. Gen classes are composable with no need for Arb classes. So less boilerplate.
- Random testing and shrinking can run in parallel. This and PCG make it very fast.
- Shrunk cases report the seed so they can be rerun. Simpler examples can easily be reproduced.
- Shrinking can be repeated to give simpler cases for high dimensional problems.</Description>
